What that means if you hopefully have a Github account. If you do not please go to [Github](https://github.com/join). Now follow the instructions below in order to start your pre-class assignment. \n\n\n## What is a Github Page?\n\n[Githubpages](https://pages.github.com/) are explained in the video below:\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MsN8gpT6jY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nYou will be building this github page so please do the following:\n\n\n1. Head over to [GitHub](www.github.com) and create a new repository named *username*.github.io, where *username* is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.\n2. Do not Clone this repository as instructed on github. Continue on to the next step first.\n\n\n## Enter Blogdown\n\nThere are many ways to build pages on github, the primary one has been to use [jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/). One issue with this is that jekyll only accepts markdown files. In class we have been seeing how amazing it can be to use [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) documents to include our R code, graphs and analysis. \n\n`Blogdown` is an R package that creates blog style sites with a new static website called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). On top of that [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is a way to incorporate RMarkdown documents into your website. Through this you can actually display your R code and projects. Then like any other blog site you can discuss your favorite things and even code analysis which would allow others to see your coding abilities and interests. \n\n\nWe need to get started with blogdown now:\n\n1. Install Blogdown:\n\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')\n```\n\n2. Start a new project.\n  - In the right hand corner of your screen start a new project in an empty directory. \n\n3.  Once you have this new project run the following code:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(blogdown)\ninstall_hugo()\nnew_site()\n```\n\n4. Now you can see what your site looks like initially:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nserve_site()\n```\n\n5. Proceed to your next task of setting this project up. \n\n\n\n\n## Setting Up Your Page\n\n\nYou now should have a very basic website. The next goal would be to install some themes and actually create some content. In order to do that I have set up an example site that you can see, [here](https://www.sullivanstatistics.com/). There are quite a few things blank but I wanted to display the capabilities for you. Now here is how you can get a similar page:\n\n\n1. Go into git and clone this repository on your computer:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Sullivanstatistics/GitHubPage.git\n```\n2. Now open up the folder:\n```\n- GitHubPage\n    -themes\n        hugo-academic\n```\nNow copy this `hugo-academic`  folder to the themes folder in your project. \n\n3. Go back to the `GitHubPage` main folder. Copy `config.toml` over to your main page and replace your old `config.toml`.\n4. Now open up the folder:\n```\n- GitHubPage\n    -content\n```\nCopy the `home` folder over to your contents. \n5. You should be able to see the page I created now, if not run `serve_site()` to see. \n6. Open up `config.toml` and replace with your information. \n7. Go into the `/project/content/home` folder and go through all the files in there replacing your information. \n\n\n\n## In Class\n\n- We will get your site live when we start class. Comment below when you are finished with all of these steps. \n\n",
