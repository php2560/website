<div id="course-description" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>Statistical computing is an essential part of analysis. Statisticians need not only be able to run existing computer software but understand how that software functions. Students will learn fundamental concepts - Data Management, Data types, Data cleaning and manipulation, databases, graphics, functions, loops, simulation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo through working with various statistical analysis. Students will learn to write code in an organized fashion with comments. This course will use a variety of web-based material from:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-format" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Format</h1>
<p>This course will be taught in a “flipped” format. Students will watch a series of videos and work through some simple coding examples before coming to class. The sequence of these will be displayed on the course website as well as a calendar for which videos need to be watched prior to attending class.</p>
<p>The classroom format will focus on labs and projects. You will be involved with computing and coding on a regular basis. Labs will form into projects which you will finish outside of class and turn in for grading.</p>
</div>
<div id="flipped-format-and-references" class="section level1">
<h1>Flipped Format and References</h1>
<p>We need to take some time to discuss what it means to have a flipped format class. In this style of formatting the note taking portion of the course will be done via videos. Think of these as video textbooks in which you gather the basic details before practicing the material.</p>
<p>In the traditional format this course would have the instructor teaching 160 minutes a week with some hands on lab activities but most coding work done outside of class. In the flipped format you will have access to these lectures as your work prior to class. You then will have 180 minutes of hands on coding projects, code sharing and time with the instructor.</p>
<p>This course will utilize a wealth of materials from many different resources aside from the textbooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of R videos will be hosted by  and created by the instructor.</li>
<li>Some notes have been adapted from:</li>
</ul>
<p> Shalizi, C. R. and A. C. Thomas (2014). . Online Course Site. .</p>
<ul>
<li>Shiny is a product of R Studio and will be presented by RStudio with example created by the last 2 classes PHP 2560 class and the instructor.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level1">

<div id="evaluation-category-details" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluation Category Details</h2>
<div id="participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>Participation will be calculated by the successful completion of videos and practice coding done prior to class as well as being present and engaged during the in class portion.</p>
<p>With the class meeting once a week it is crucial that all students attend. Any student who needs to miss a class must inform the instructor by 9 am the morning of the class. Unexcused absences will result in a 5% reduction in overall course grade.</p>
</div>
<div id="pre-class-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Pre-Class Assignments</h3>
<p>At the end of the videos each week a preview of the in class lab will need to be completed. This will ensure that all students are prepared to work on the material in the lab. Once this assignment is turned in, each student will be required to peer review code of a number of other students. Code will be graded and commented on based on criteria given out in class. Each students grade will be a combination of there own work as well as their peer reviewing of other students code.</p>
</div>
<div id="in-class-project" class="section level3">
<h3>In-Class Project</h3>
<p>Projects will be a culmination of in class labs with some extra parameters associated with them. Most of the work on Projects will be done in groups</p>
</div>
<div id="r-package" class="section level3">
<h3>R Package</h3>
<p>Another useful skill with R is to take methods, data or other user created tools and turn them into a package. Students will work in groups to create an R Package as directed by the instructor.</p>
</div>
<div id="shiny-app" class="section level3">
<h3>Shiny App</h3>
<p>An important part of statistics is the visualization and representation of data. Students will be expected to code and build their own Shiny Apps.</p>
