# Course Description


Statistical computing is an essential part of analysis. Statisticians need not only be able to run existing computer software but understand how that software functions. Students will learn fundamental concepts - Data Management, Data types, Data cleaning and manipulation, databases, graphics, functions, loops, simulation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo through working with various statistical analysis. Students will learn to write code in an organized fashion with comments. This course will use a variety of web-based material from:

- \href{www.statseducation.com}{www.statseducation.com}
- \href{rstudio.sullivanstatistics.com}{rstudio.sullivanstatistics.com}
- \href{https://www.github.com}{Github}

# Course Format


This course will be taught in a "flipped" format. Students will watch a series of videos and work through some simple coding examples before coming to class.  The sequence of these will be displayed on the course website as well as a calendar for which videos need to be watched prior to attending class. 

The classroom format will focus on labs and projects. You will be involved with computing and coding on a regular basis. Labs will form into projects which you will finish outside of class and turn in for grading. 


# Flipped Format and References


We need to take some time to discuss what it means to have a flipped format class. In this style of formatting the note taking portion of the course will be done via videos. Think of these as video textbooks in which you gather the basic details before practicing the material. 

In the traditional format this course would have the instructor teaching 160 minutes a week with some hands on lab activities but most coding work done outside of class. In the flipped format you will have access to these lectures as your work prior to class. You then will have 180 minutes of hands on coding projects, code sharing and time with the instructor. 

This course will utilize a wealth of materials from many different resources aside from the textbooks:

- The majority of R videos will be hosted by \href{www.statseducation.com}{www.statseducation.com} and created by the instructor. 
- Some notes have been adapted from:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", message= FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
bib["36350"]
``` 

- Shiny is a product of R Studio and will be presented by RStudio with example created by the last 2 classes PHP 2560 class and the instructor. 






# Prerequisites

Students should have courses in probability and statistical inference at the level of PHP 2510.


# Recommended Textbooks

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", message= FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
bib["Matloff"]
``` 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", message= FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
bib["Rizzo"]
``` 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", message= FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
bib["Jones"]
``` 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis", message= FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
bib["Teetor"]
``` 






# Course Objectives

After the successful completion of this course, you will understand and be able to implement the fundamental principles of statistical computing in R.   In particular these include the following capabilities:

1. item Obtain and work with Data.
2. 	Clean and Transform data into usable dataframes.
3. 	Create Graphics. 
4. 	Understand the writing and use of functions. 
5. Working with larger dataframes efficiently. 
6. Perform Statistical Optimizations
7.  Code and run an MCMC.
8.  Data visualization. 
9.  Relational Databases




# Overall Course Expectations

Students in this course will be expected to do the following:

1. Attend all lectures and actively participate in in class sessions, for every class missed there will be a 5% reduction in overall grade.  
2. Complete all assigned flipped material *prior* to coming to class and be prepared to work on in class lab. 
3. Complete and turn in all assignments on time. All assignments will be graded on ability of code to work, quality of coding and quality of comments on code. 
4. Demonstrate an understanding on material on all projects.  
5. Respect each other, each others questions and each others discussion. 
6. Peer review other students code. 

#Evaluation


Students will be evaluated based on:


-------------------------------------------------
Grade Category          Percentage
---------------------- ---------------------------------
Participation               15%

Pre-Class Assignments       20%

In-Class Projects           20%

R Package                   15%

Shiny App                   30%
--------------------------------------------------

## Evaluation Category Details


### Participation

Participation will be calculated by the successful completion of videos and practice coding done prior to class as well as being present and engaged during the in class portion. 

With the class meeting once a week it is crucial that all students attend. Any student who needs to miss a class must inform the instructor by 9 am the morning of the class. Unexcused absences will result in a 5% reduction in overall course grade.  

### Pre-Class Assignments

At the end of the videos each week a preview of the in class lab will need to be completed. This will ensure that all students are prepared to work on the material in the lab. Once this assignment is turned in, each student will be required to peer review code of a number of other students. Code will be graded and commented on based on criteria given out in class. Each students grade will be a combination of there own work as well as their peer reviewing of other students code. 



### In-Class Project

Projects will be a culmination of in class labs with some extra parameters associated with them. Most of the work on Projects will be done in groups

### R Package

Another useful skill with R is to take methods, data or other user created tools and turn them into a package. Students will work in groups to create an R Package as directed by the instructor. 


### Shiny App

An important part of statistics is the visualization and representation of data. Students will be expected to code and build their own Shiny Apps.
